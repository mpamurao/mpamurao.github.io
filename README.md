Project 1 - Minesweeper

Created HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to build the Minesweeper game.
Github Pages: https://mpamurao.github.io/Project1_Minesweeper/

How to Play:

Click on a square to display its value of a number, bomb, or blank. If it's a bomb, the game is over and the player lost. If it's a number, the number indicates how many bombs border it. If it's a blank, the board will reveal all the bordering blanks until a number is revealed. 

Right-click on a square to show a flag. The initial number of flags correspond to the number of bombs that are on the board. Flagged squares do not reveal the value underneath the square when left-clicked. Right-click on a flagged square to unflag it.

Once the board reveals all the blanks and numbers, the game is over and the player won.

Unsolved problems:

For the larger grids (Medium and Hard), it takes longer to load the game and could freeze the browser temporarily. This is probably due to inefficiencies in the code. 

The more times the game is reset using the smiley icon, the longer it takes to load.
